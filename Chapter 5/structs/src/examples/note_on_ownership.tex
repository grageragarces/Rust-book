It’s also possible for structs possible store references to data owned by something else, 
but to do so requires the use of lifetimes (Chap 10). 
Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.
If you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes it won’t work (see broken_lifetime.rs)
